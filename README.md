## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. 

* The purpose of this analysis was to find the best machine learning model to predict who would default on a loan they took out. Multiple models did a great job of doing that. Examples of those models include  the logistic regression, SVC model, KNN model and the XGBoost.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic regression
    * Description of Model 1
    * Accuracy: 99
    * Precision: 98
    * Recall scores: 87
 
*  Machine Learning Model 2: Decision Tree
    * Description of Model 2
    * Accuracy: 99
    * Precision: 87
    * Recall scores: 81
   
* Machine Learning Model 3: Random Forest
    * Description of Model 3
    * Accuracy: 99
    * Precision: 88
    * Recall scores: 88

    * Recall scores: 82

* Machine Learning Model 7: AdaBoost
    * Description of Model 7
    * Accuracy: 100
    * Precision: 87
    * Recall scores: 99
      
 
*  Machine Learning Model 8: XGBoost
    * Description of Model 8
    * Accuracy: 100
    * Precision: 87
    * Recall scores: 99

 


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* While models like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN, and AdaBoost all preferred very well it is the SVC Model with 100 accuracy and 100 recall that tops this list. The other models mentioned come close but none had both 100 percent accuracy and 100 percent recall. For this reason I would recommend the SVC model.
