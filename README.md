## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. 

* The purpose of this analysis was to find the best machine learning model to predict who would default on a loan they took out. Multiple models did a great job of doing that. Examples of those models include  the logistic regression, SVC model, KNN model and the XGBoost.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
